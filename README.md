# cljfmt

![cljfmt](images/web.png)

This extension is a wrapper for the `cljfmt` formatting tool.

## Note

`cljfmt` doesn't take care of indentation like Paredit or Parinfer, neither will format your code as you type. If you are looking for a Clojure & ClojureScript programming environment for VS Code, it's a good idea to check Calva and the other extensions.

If you already have Calva installed, please be aware that formatting may not work properly since both extensions will try to format your code.

`cljfmt` doesn't need a REPL connection to format your code and it will work without any configuration.


Built with [Shadow CLJS](http://shadow-cljs.org/).
